Servers and client libraries for nodal digital asset management

# Overview

## server-nodejs
A Javascript implementation of the server for NodeJS which development started in April 2015. Specifications redesign, enhanced graph structures, web token authentication, integration of long-time requested features. MongoDB backend. This version is used in production and stable. Some functions are still missing though, please see the documentation.

## server-php
A PHP server to run in a Apache environment. Generic key-value data model, simple graph structures, user authentication, file version control, using MySQL as database. It supports database replication among multiple sites. Used in production and maintained since 2007. The Php version is still used in production, very stable, and maintained. We intend to make it evolve to the new specifications some days. 

## py and js
The Python and Javascript libraries to access the server remotely, interface its methods and process the JSON results using the language native objects.
* Setup a scripting environment using this [guide](https://github.com/remyla/damas-core/wiki/Scripting)
* The documentation of the methods is available in the [API Reference](https://github.com/remyla/damas-core/wiki/API)

# Usage
Choose a server to run (either the Php or the NodeJS server). Refer to the README.md files in the servers folders for the installation instructions. Then use the Python or Javascript libraries to access it, of which instructions can be found in the wiki.
